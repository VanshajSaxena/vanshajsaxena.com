Hello everyone 👋

It’s been a bit since my last update, and I’ve been focusing all my energy in building out the companion desktop experience.

I’m excited to share another round of progress as I move closer to the first public beta 🚀

• 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁, the core 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 is nearing completion. It now handles order management and real-time event propagation reliably, forming the backbone of a much more robust and scalable system.
• 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱, the overall 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 is stabilizing beautifully. By following an Elm-inspired approach in the renderer, the app behavior is now 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 and predictable, which makes debugging, scaling, and building new features significantly smoother.
• 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗱, printers can now 𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 in real time. This gives shop owners more control over their workflow and ensures only active devices receive incoming jobs.
• 𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘁𝗵, authentication is now in place with 𝗢𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵 Google SSO and traditional username password login, making onboarding faster while still keeping things flexible.

Behind the scenes, this desktop companion is shaping up to solve some very real problems:

• 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗱𝗯𝘆𝗲 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁𝘀𝗔𝗽𝗽 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗼𝘀 - all incoming jobs are neatly organized in one dedicated queue.
• 𝗨𝗦𝗕 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘂𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 - no more risky pen drives, everything flows securely through the cloud.
• 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 - receive, prepare, and clear jobs seamlessly.
• 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗣𝗖 𝗘𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 - no more cluttered downloads folder.
• 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 - a smoother experience that keeps users coming back.

These updates are all about building a reliable and predictable system while keeping the real world workflow of print shops in mind.

Getting closer to beta every single day, excited to share more soon.

Would love to hear your thoughts or feedback!
